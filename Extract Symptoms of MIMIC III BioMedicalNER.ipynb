He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.  Cardiorespiratory arrest.\\n 2.  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.\\n 3.  Acute renal failure.\\n 4.

Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.

Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.

NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\",\n","        \"input\": [\n","            \"hypertension\",\n","            \"vomited\",\n","            \"slumped\",\n","            \"hyper\",\n","            \"##ema\",\n","            \"unable to talk\",\n","            \"supple\",\n","            \"strokes\",\n","            \"less responsive\",\n","            \"##thy\",\n","            \"cyanosis\",\n","            \"l\",\n","            \"ed\",\n","            \"inability\",\n","            \"noxious stimuli\",\n","            \"weakness\"\n","        ],\n","        \"output\": \"Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"instruction\": \"       \\n\\n       Sex:  F\\n\\nService:\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl  is a 1,385\\ngram, former 30 and  week premature baby, born to an 18\\nyear old, Gravida I, Para 0, now I, mother with prenatal\\nserologies as follows:\\n\\nA positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B\\nsurface antigen negative; GBS unknown.\\n\\nPregnancy was complicated by PPROM on  when the\\nmother was transferred from  Hospital to .

The largest mass in the right parietal lobe has a\\ncomplex appearance, at least 5 cm in greatest dimension with at\\nleast 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema and 7 mm\\nleftward midline shift.\\\" Dr.  is a member of the\\n\\\"Nighthawk\\\" Radiology group.\\n\\nFINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal,\\nirregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny\\n\\\"daughter\\\" cystic components extending towards the cortical\\nsurface. As mentioned in the wet , there is a substantial\\narea of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right atrium\\nand approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation. A smaller\\narea of edema is seen within the white matter of the left\\noccipital lobe, but I cannot delineate any specific area of\\nenhancement associated with it. A third, very well circumscribed\\n18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen contiguous to the\\nleft temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether the\\nlesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale. Again, there is no\\nassociated enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted,\\neither. On the coronal post-contrast images, there is a\\nquestionable area of enhancement, approximately 3 mm,\\nimmediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am not\\ncertain that the two findings are necessarily related. The\\nprincipal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is no\\novert extracranial abnormality noted.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent\\neither a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm. The additional\\nabnormalities within the left temporal lobe and left occipital\\nlobe, while they may represent extremely unusual manifestations\\nof metastatic disease, which would then render the right\\nparietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have\\nalternative diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left\\ntemporal meningioma as an explanation for the left temporal\\nlesion, and either an inflammatory or ischemic process to\\naccount for the left occipital lesion. I discussed this case\\nthis morning with Dr. , it was decided that a non-contrast\\nhead CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to\\nfurther characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior\\nto brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.\\n\\nDR.  \\nApproved:   4:07 PM\\n\\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   3:50 PM\\n\\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\\n\\nReason: please evaluate preop\\n\\n MEDICAL CONDITION:\\n50 year old woman with bilateral masses\\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\\nplease evaluate preop\\nINDICATION: Bilateral brain masses for pre-op evaluation.\\n\\nPORTABLE CHEST: There are no priors for comparison.

The heart was regular in rate and rhythm.\\nThe lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There was a\\nwell-healed midline scar and ileostomy present.  The\\nextremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His hematocrit\\nwas 43.2.  His INR was 1.2.  Creatinine was 1.6.  Aspartate\\naminotransferase was 51, his alanine-aminotransferase was 89,\\nhis alkaline phosphatase was 395, and his total bilirubin was\\n12.5.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission,\\nthe patient was taken to the operating room where an\\nexploratory laparotomy was performed.  The patient had\\nevidence of unresectable pancreatic cancer with biliary\\nobstruction seen intraoperatively.  Adhesiolysis was\\ntherefore performed along with a Roux-en-Y\\nhepaticojejunostomy, and open cholecystectomy, an open\\npancreatic biopsy, and a gastrojejunostomy.  The estimated\\nblood loss for the procedure was 250 cc.\\n\\nThe patient was discharged to the regular hospital floor\\nafter being extubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit in good\\ncondition.\\n\\nIn the evening on postoperative day one, the patient was\\ntaken back to the operating room emergently for likely\\nmesenteric bleeding.  This was controlled with suture\\nligation, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical\\nIntensive Care Unit postoperatively for close monitoring.\\nThe patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit on\\npressor support and received total parenteral nutrition until\\npostoperative day seven.  At this time, the patient's mental\\nstatus was extremely labile requiring Haldol for agitation.\\nThe patient's hematocrit was stable at 35.8 at this time.\\n\\nTube feeds were initiated on postoperative day eight.  On\\npostoperative day nine, the patient was transferred to the\\nregular hospital floor.  At this time, tube feeds were held\\nfor elevated residuals and nausea.  He was still receiving\\ntotal parenteral nutrition at this time.  The patient's\\nmental status was still not completely improved.  A computed\\ntomography scan was performed on postoperative day ten which\\ndid not demonstrate any intra-abdominal pathology.\\n\\nThe patient was started on sips on postoperative day eleven\\nand was started on his home medications.  At this time, he\\nwas seen by the Physical Therapy Service and was being\\nscreened for rehabilitation placement.\\n\\nHowever, on the evening on postoperative day twelve the\\npatient spiked a temperature to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  A\\nfever workup was done including a chest x-ray and blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nEarly the next morning, the patient was found unresponsive\\nwithout a pulse at approximately 2:45 a.m.  At this time, a\\ncode blue was called and advanced cardiac life support\\nprotocol was initiated.

For the\\npast six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous\\nexercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually\\nresolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with\\nwalking. She does acknowledge that there is associated\\nnausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she\\nstarted to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.\\nShe was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,\\nwhere she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was\\nreferred to  for cardiac catheterization today, which\\nrevealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to\\nher transfer to , she did complain of chest pain and\\nback pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip\\nwas started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of\\nIV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the\\ncath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now\\nshe is not actively complaining of any pain.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity\\nedema, but she does acknowledge that she does have\\ndysmenorrhea.\\n\\nPRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,\\ndiagnosed in . She has been able to control it with diet\\nsince ; hypertension and obesity; however, she has\\nlost 40 pounds in the last six months.\\n\\nSHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO :  Atenolol 50 mg a day,\\nlisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg\\nonce a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,\\nAtivan.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol\\nand she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.\\nHer brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial\\ninfarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She\\ndoes have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,\\nin no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse\\n72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.\\nHead and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes\\nmoist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:\\nRegular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation\\nbilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but\\nshe is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities\\nare warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all\\nextremities.\\n\\nHer laboratories prior to admission from  were\\nwhite count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.\\nHemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,\\nchloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total\\ncholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.\\n\\n, which was at  (it was not at\\n), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior\\ndescending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;\\n50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;\\nmoderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection\\nfraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right\\ncoronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than\\nwhat was actually reported on the initial catheterization\\nresults from . This was discussed between Dr.  and Dr. , and was not actually considered to be\\n80% as previously reported.\\n\\nSo this was a woman who was considered to have unstable\\nangina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an\\nintraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,\\nand was \\\"preoped\\\" and consented for a CABG on the next day\\nbecause of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.\\nafter midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the\\noperating room.\\n\\nOn of , Ms.  went to the\\noperating room with Dr.  for bypass surgery.\\nPlease refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.\\n for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,\\nthree grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to\\nthe left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous\\nvein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on\\ncardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross\\nclamped for 53 of those minutes.\\n\\nShe tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the\\nintensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.\\n\\nPostoperatively, Ms.  did extremely well. Her\\nintraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips\\nwere discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative\\nday two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she\\nwas transferred to the floor. Ms.  major floor issues\\nwere as follows.\\n\\nMs.  was followed by physical therapy, which cleared\\nher to go home with home physical therapy to assist with\\nmobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively\\ndiuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted\\naccordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia\\nwhile she resumed her regular diet.   consultation\\nwas obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a\\nday to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an\\noutpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup\\nappointment.\\n\\nOn  the patient's central line was discontinued.\\nShe was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;\\nhowever, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to\\nbe more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and\\nan EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this\\nchest pain.\\n\\nShe is, therefore, on , postoperative day six,\\nbeing discharged home in good condition with home physical\\ntherapy scheduled.\\n\\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\\n1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\\n2.  Hypertension.\\n3.  Obesity.\\n4.  Hyperlipidemia.\\n5.  Unstable angina.\\n6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post\\ncoronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic\\nballoon pump.\\n7.  Hypokalemia.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.\\n2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.\\n4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\n5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.\\n6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.\\n7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.;  follow your blood sugar\\nlevels and follow up with .\\n8.
