He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the\\nfirst 6 weeks after surgery.\\n\\nDIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal\\ntransplant.\\nArterial thrombosis.\\nDeep venous

THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old\\nAfrican-American male with a history of hypertension who was\\nin his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the\\nmorning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n   \n","\n","                                                  ICD9_CODE  \\\n","0  [2639, 6826, 4280, 41071, 4254, 5849, 78559, 0389, 4275]   \n","1   [E9317, 042, 1363, 7994, 2763, 7907, 5715, 04111, V090]   \n","2        [40391, 4440, 9972, 2766, 2767, 2859, 2753, V1582]   \n","3                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","4                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               DIAGNOSIS_DESC  \n","0                                         [Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition, Cellulitis and abscess of leg, except foot, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Subendocardial infarction, initial episode of care, Other primary cardiomyopathies, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Other shock without mention of trauma, Unspecified septicemia, Cardiac arrest]  \n","1  [Antiviral drugs causing adverse effects in therapeutic use, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease, Pneumocystosis, Cachexia, Alkalosis, Bacteremia, Cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol, Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site, Infection with microorganisms resistant to penicillins]  \n","2                                                                        [Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage V or end stage renal disease, nan, Peripheral vascular complications, not elsewhere classified, nan, Hyperpotassemia, Anemia, unspecified, Disorders of phosphorus metabolism, Personal history of tobacco use]  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-dcdc971a-8af8-4f4a-ae34-c8242e12bfb2\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>HADM_ID</th>\n","      <th>SUBJECT_ID</th>\n","      <th>AGE</th>\n","      <th>GENDER</th>\n","      <th>NOTES</th>\n","      <th>ICD9_CODE</th>\n","      <th>DIAGNOSIS_DESC</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>145834.0</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>76.0</td>\n","      <td>M</td>\n","      <td>\\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:  Medicine\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for\\nhypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and\\ndecreased urine output.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old\\nmale who had been hospitalized at the  from  through  of \\nafter undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was\\nsubsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nOn , he presented again to the  after being found to have a systolic\\nblood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.\\nA Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility\\nyielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.  Primaquine 26.3 two tablets by mouth every day (times 14\\ndays).\\n 5.  Levoxyl 25 mcg by mouth once per day.\\n 6.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg by mouth once per\\nday.\\n 7.

She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T &amp; B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.

Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n</td>\n","      <td>[431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]</td>\n","      <td>[Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-dcdc971a-8af8-4f4a-ae34-c8242e12bfb2')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-dcdc971a-8af8-4f4a-ae34-c8242e12bfb2 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ICD9_CODE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DIAGNOSIS_DESC\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f042f288","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753846081597,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":42,"user":{"displayName":"Pasindu Ambegoda","userId":"06530733606875410990"}},"outputId":"f3515b6b-69e0-4ac3-e899-7ae7f80d8b35"},"source":["print(\"Columns in notes_merged:\")\n","print(notes_merged.columns)\n","print(\"\\nColumns in patients:\")\n","print(patients.columns)"],"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Columns in notes_merged:\n","Index(['ROW_ID', 'SUBJECT_ID_x', 'HADM_ID', 'CHARTDATE', 'CHARTTIME',\n","       'STORETIME', 'CATEGORY', 'DESCRIPTION', 'CGID', 'ISERROR', 'TEXT',\n","       'SUBJECT_ID_y', 'ADMITTIME', 'SUBJECT_ID', 'DOB', 'GENDER', 'AGE'],\n","      dtype='object')\n","\n","Columns in patients:\n","Index(['ROW_ID', 'SUBJECT_ID', 'GENDER', 'DOB', 'DOD', 'DOD_HOSP', 'DOD_SSN',\n","       'EXPIRE_FLAG'],\n","      dtype='object')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8c6ae434"},"source":["## Print notes from the cleaned data\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Generate code to display the 'NOTES' column of the `final_df` DataFrame."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"af618db6"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","Access the 'NOTES' column of the `final_df` DataFrame and display its content."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"collapsed":true,"id":"f1c7b521","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753846084189,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":149,"user":{"displayName":"Pasindu Ambegoda","userId":"06530733606875410990"}},"outputId":"158adcea-4797-4877-c909-4d11d75f72fd"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Set display options to show more characters in the 'NOTES' column\n","pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)\n","\n","print(\"Notes from the cleaned data:\")\n","display(final_df['NOTES'])"],"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Notes from the cleaned data:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["0             \\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:  Medicine\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for\\nhypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and\\ndecreased urine output.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old\\nmale who had been hospitalized at the  from  through  of \\nafter undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was\\nsubsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nOn , he presented again to the  after being found to have a systolic\\nblood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.\\nA Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility\\nyielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

F\\n\\nService:\\n\\n\\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for\\ntransplant surgery.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old\\nwoman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant\\nhypertension. She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T & B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the\\nfirst 6 weeks after surgery.\\n\\nDIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal\\ntransplant.\\nArterial thrombosis.\\nDeep venous

OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old\\nAfrican-American male with a history of hypertension who was\\nin his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the\\nmorning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\n","

PT 12.0, INR 1.0, PTT 20.7.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.3,\\nchloride 98, CO2 32, BUN 31, creatinine 1.6, and a glucose of\\n283.  AL7 176, AST 21, amylase 71, alkaline phosphatase 165,\\ntotal bilirubin 1.2.\\n\\nKUB on admission showed colonic distention and stool and air\\nin the rectum distal colon.\\n\\nCLINICAL COURSE:  This patient originally presented on\\n with an approximately six week history of\\npruritus, 12 pound unintentional weight loss, dark urine, and\\nlight stools.   At that time, he was noted to have increased\\nLFTs, so ERCP was performed on .  No obstruction or\\nlesion was found, although a stent was placed ultimately\\nleading to no relief.\\n\\nSubsequent workup by GI Hepatology showed that the patient\\nhad autoimmune hepatitis, and liver biopsy was found to be\\nconsistent with this.  Patient was then started on prednisone\\nwith relief of symptoms.  On the Friday prior to admission,\\nthe patient had his stent removed.  The following morning at\\napproximately 3 a.m., the patient awoke constipated with\\ndiffuse  abdominal pain radiating to the back, steady,\\nbut not crampy.  There is no change in the pain, intensity,\\nor quality based on position, eating, or activity.  There was\\nassociated nausea and vomiting during the entire morning and\\nfollowing day.\\n\\nCT scan performed that morning showed uniformly dilated colon\\nwith air in the colon wall (pneumatosis).  Air was also seen\\nin the portal system and small amount of air tracking along\\nthe colon wall.  Based on the these results, the patient was\\nstarted immediately on IV antibiotics, and transferred to the\\nSurgical Intensive Care Unit.  From the Intensive Care Unit,\\nthe patient underwent a right hemicolectomy, with creation of\\na diverting ileostomy and mucus fistula.  Following the\\nsurgery on the , patient returned to the Intensive\\nCare Unit and was paced on the ventilator for respiratory\\nsupport.\\n\\nOn postoperative day three, on , the patient was\\nsuccessfully extubated and his supportive requirements were\\ngradually decreased.  On , the patient was\\ntransferred from the Intensive Care Unit to a normal patient\\ncare floor.\\n\\nOn the floor, he continued to progress well with bowel\\nfunction gradually returning over the next several days.  On\\n, his diet was advanced from sips to clear liquids\\nto full liquids and ultimately soft foods.  He tolerated all\\nof this without problem or episode.  Following a Physical\\nTherapy consult and evaluate on  and conferring\\nwith the attending surgeon, it was felt that the patient was\\na suitable candidate for discharge.\\n\\nPrior to his departure, he completed full training with both\\nthe wound care nurse and the ostomy nurse at the .\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, patient is stable,\\ntolerating full p.o.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is discharged to home with\\nvisiting nursing.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.

70-year-old man with\\ncomplaint of shortness of breath and decrease oxygen\\nsaturation.  Patient complains of one week of cough with\\nproductive yellow sputum and increased shortness of breath\\nover the last two days.  Patient has orthopnea and is unable\\nto sleep secondary to shortness of breath.  Patient has also\\nnoted nausea and vomiting with black stool recently.  Patient\\nhas increased his dose of Naprosyn because of abdominal pain.\\nThe patient denies any chest pain.  Patient has a history of\\ndyspnea on exertion and pleural effusions diagnosed in\\n.  Patient had a previous thoracentesis with\\nunclear diagnosis to date.  Review of systems otherwise\\nnegative.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient had a myocardial infarction in\\n.  Patient has hypercholesterolemia, seborrhea keratosis,\\n\"arthritis,\" benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic\\nobstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Atenolol, Lipitor and\\nNaprosyn three times a day.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for bladder cancer.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for 20 pack year smoking history.\\nHistory of exposure to asbestos, occasional ethanol use.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nHis primary care physician is  .  His pulmonologist\\nis Dr. .\\n\\nIn the Emergency Department, patient was started on\\nlevofloxacin because of concern for pneumonia.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, this is a 70-year-old male\\nwho was speaking in brief phrases and has some diaphoresis.\\nVital signs:  Temperature of 100.5.  Heart rate in the 140s.\\nBlood pressure 120/70.  02 saturation is 95% on five liters.\\nHead is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and\\nreactive to light with extraocular motions intact.  There are\\ndry mucous membranes.  There is no jugular venous distention.\\nOropharynx is clear but dry.  The neck is supple without\\nlymphadenopathy.  Lung exam demonstrates diffuse rales with\\negophony.  There is bibasilar dullness to percussion, left\\ngreater than right.  Heart is tachycardic S1, S2, no S3.\\nAbdomen is soft, obese, nondistended with a Foley in the\\nbladder.  Extremities:  There is no cyanosis, clubbing or\\nedema.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are\\nintact.  Rectal:  Heme negative stool.\\n\\nElectrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 110 beats per\\nminute with a left axis deviation and T wave inversions in\\nlead III.\\n\\nChest x-ray demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions with\\nleft side greater than the right.  There are also increased\\novular opacities, possible pneumonia or congestive heart\\nfailure.\\n\\nLABORATORIES:  White blood cell count is 24, hematocrit 41.6,\\nplatelets 245,000.  Differential for the white blood cell\\ncount has 92% neutrophils, 5% bands, 1% lymphocytes, 2%\\nmonocytes.

Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.  An echocardiogram demonstrated no\\nsystolic dysfunction.  Given need for oxygen and no systolic\\ndysfunction on echocardiogram, diastolic congestive heart\\nfailure was suspected.\\n\\n2.  Pulmonary:  On the evening of admission, patient was\\nbecoming more diaphoretic and short of breath.  Serial\\narterial blood gases demonstrated increasing acidosis and\\nhypercarbia, therefore, requiring a transfer to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit on  for respiratory distress and\\nacidosis.  The patient was placed on BiPAP and given\\nSolu-Medrol.  The patient did well with BiPAP over two days\\nand patient's respiratory distress resolved.  Chest CT\\ndemonstrated pleural thickening with nodular characteristics\\nand question of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Patient was\\ncontinued on Levaquin that was started in the Emergency\\nDepartment for possible pneumonia.  On , patient was\\ntransferred back to the floor where his right pleural\\neffusion was tapped.  On , the left pleural effusion\\nwas also tapped at the recommendation of the Pulmonary\\nconsult.  The etiology of the pulmonary effusions was\\nunclear, but the differential diagnoses included malignancy,\\nrheumatoid lung and pneumonia.  The fluid was sent for\\nmultiple studies.  The etiology of the effusions remained\\nunclear.\\n\\nOn , patient received a thoracoscopy by\\nInterventional Pulmonology for a biopsy of the lungs.  The\\npatient was scheduled to follow-up with Dr. , who is\\nthe Pulmonologist, and also Dr. , who performed the lung\\nbiopsy.\\n\\n3.  Gastrointestinal:  Given the history of black stools,\\npatient's serial hematocrits were followed.  There was no\\ndrop in the hematocrit throughout the admission.  Patient was\\nscheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy for work-up of a\\npossible gastrointestinal malignancy.  Given suspicion of\\nrheumatoid lung based on the Pulmonary consult\\nrecommendation, a Rheumatology consult was obtained.\\n\\n4.  Rheumatology:  Multiple laboratory tests were performed\\nincluding   which was negative, rheumatoid factor which\\nwas also negative.  A CRP level was 19.5.  ESR level was\\nelevated at 105.  Multiple protein immunoelectrophoresis\\nlaboratories were performed which demonstrated an elevated\\nIgG level at 3058, but normal IgA, IgM levels.  The patient\\nalso had complements drawn.  C3 was normal.  C4 was low and\\nHCV antibody was negative.  Patient was negative for\\nlegionella.   Adenosine deaminase level was known to be\\nelevated from .  All blood cultures and pleural\\nfluid cultures were negative.  Cytology was also negative.\\nRheumatology suspected that a rheumatoid lung was less likely\\ngiven that patient had no evidence for inflammatory arthritis\\nby x-ray examination of extremities.  Patient was scheduled\\nfor a Rheumatology follow-up with Dr. .\\n\\n5.  Renal:  Patient's creatinine was elevated from 1.4 to 1.6\\nbut recovered with fluid hydration.  Creatinine was back to\\nbaseline at 1.4.  Patient was suspected of dehydration\\nbecause of low sodium level, a urine osmolalities greater\\nthan 100 and urine sodium was approximately 20 to 30.\\nPatient also had decreased skin turgor.  Patient did well\\nwith fluid hydration.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Levaquin 250 mg po q.d.\\n2.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.\\n3.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.\\n4.  Lactulose.\\n5.

    Sex:  F\\n\\nService:  NB\\n\\n\\nThis is an interim summary for this patient.  The infant was\\nborn at 26 2/7 weeks.  This summary is for the month of .\\nHer hospital course by systems is as follows.\\n\\nRespiratory.  The infant was on CPAP at 6 in room air until\\n at which time she was reintubated secondary to\\nmultiple apneic bradycardiac spells.  She was initially on\\nsetting of 18/5 and a rate of 16.  However, due to increasing\\ndesaturation, slight hypercarbia and decreased volumes on\\nchest x-ray, her settings were slowly increased over the\\nfollowing 1 1/2 weeks to a peak of 25/7 and a rate of 22.\\nShe received one dose of Lasix on  and then received\\nLasix on  and  due to evidence of pulmonary edema on\\nchest x-ray.  On  (day of life 33), the infant self-\\nextubated and was given a trial of CPAP of 7 where she\\ncurrently remains in 29 to 33 percent FIO2.  Blood gas on\\nCPAP of 7 was 7.4, 46, 32, 24.  Plan will be maintaining on\\nCPAP with a slow wean and she grows.  The infant is not on\\nchronic diuretics at this time, although she did have some\\nbenefit from the Lasix that she did receive.\\n\\nCardiovascular.  The infant has not had a murmur and has\\nremained cardiovascularly stable without need for pressor\\nsupport.  She has remained on caffeine which was increased to\\n10 mg per kg per day.  Since she has been extubated, she has\\nhad no apnea, bradycardia.\\n\\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The infant had a central\\nPICC line in place and was on TPN and Intralipid.  She was\\nslowly advanced on enteral feedings and reached full feedings\\non day of life 13.  She has been advanced on calories and is\\ncurrently receiving PE 30 plus ProMod all NG with appropriate\\nweight gain.  She was also started on Fer-In- and vitamin\\nE once she reached full enteral feedings.  She remains on\\nthose medications at this time.  Her most recent set of\\nelectrolytes done on  was 135, 5.3, 102, 27.  These\\nwere done the day after she received her most recent dose of\\nLasix.  The infant currently has no IV access.  The infant\\nhad hyponatremia once she reached full enteral feedings with\\nsodium as low as 130 for which she was placed on 2 mEq per\\nday of enteral sodium chloride supplement.  Her most recent\\nsodium was 135 and this was after receiving one dose of\\nLasix.\\n\\nGI.  Serial bilirubins were followed and she was treated with\\nphototherapy beginning on day of life 2.  Her peak bilirubin\\nwas 2.9/0.3 on day of life 3.  Phototherapy was discontinued\\non day of life 8 and her rebound bilirubin was 2.1/0.4 on day\\nof life 9.\\n\\nHematology.  Initial hematocrit was 41.  The infant was\\ntransfused on day of life 5 for blood out.  Repeat hematocrit\\non day of life 12 was 32.5.  Due to increased spells she was\\ntransfused 20 cc per kg on day of life 14 and then again on\\nday of life 28.  She has had no further transfusions and has\\nnot had repeat hematocrit or reticulocyte count since prior\\nto her most recent transfusion.\\n\\nInfectious disease.  The infant was initially treated with\\nampicillin and gentamicin for the first 48 hours of life.\\nCultures were negative and antibiotics were discontinued.  On\\nday of life 12 she had CBC and blood culture drawn secondary\\nto question of redness around her umbilicus and was placed on\\noxacillin initially, but then was switched to vancomycin and\\ngentamicin.  These were continued for 72 hours while awaiting\\ncultures that were negative.  She was clinically improved\\nafter intubation over this time and antibiotics were\\ndiscontinued.  She has had no further issues with potential\\ninfection since that time.\\n\\nNeurology.  The infant had initial head ultrasound done on\\nday of life 5 that was normal.  She also had a repeat done on\\nday of life 29 that was normal.  She will need a repeat head\\nultrasound on day of life 60.\\n\\nPKU.  Initial PKU was abnormal in several aspects and was\\nresent.  Results from  were normal and results from\\n after she had reached 1500 gm were normal except\\nhemoglobin electrophoresis was consistent with the fact that\\nshe had been recently transfused.\\n\\nThe infant has not received any immunizations to date.\\n\\nSocial.  The infant's parents are in and visit her often.\\nThey live in , , and do not yet have a\\npediatrician chosen.\\n\\nDIAGNOSES:\\n1. Prematurity at 26 2/7 weeks.\\n2. Respiratory distress syndrome.\\n3. Rule out sepsis, negative times two.\\n4. Hyperbilirubinemia, resolved.\\n5. Apnea of prematurity.\\n6. Chronic lung disease.\\n7. Anemia of prematurity, status post blood transfusion times\\n   three.\\n8. Feeding immaturity.\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1. Vitamin A completed 12 doses.\\n2. Vitamin E 5 units PG q.day.\\n3.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.

She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T &amp; B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.

Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.

NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>13058</th>\n","      <td>\\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with\\nknown autoimmune hepatitis, who presented to the  with acute onset abdominal pain\\nultimately leading to a colonic resection for ischemic gut.\\n\\nPRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.

At that time, he was noted to have increased\\nLFTs, so ERCP was performed on .  No obstruction or\\nlesion was found, although a stent was placed ultimately\\nleading to no relief.\\n\\nSubsequent workup by GI Hepatology showed that the patient\\nhad autoimmune hepatitis, and liver biopsy was found to be\\nconsistent with this.  Patient was then started on prednisone\\nwith relief of symptoms.  On the Friday prior to admission,\\nthe patient had his stent removed.  The following morning at\\napproximately 3 a.m., the patient awoke constipated with\\ndiffuse  abdominal pain radiating to the back, steady,\\nbut not crampy.  There is no change in the pain, intensity,\\nor quality based on position, eating, or activity.

Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.  An echocardiogram demonstrated no\\nsystolic dysfunction.  Given need for oxygen and no systolic\\ndysfunction on echocardiogram, diastolic congestive heart\\nfailure was suspected.\\n\\n2.  Pulmonary:  On the evening of admission, patient was\\nbecoming more diaphoretic and short of breath.  Serial\\narterial blood gases demonstrated increasing acidosis and\\nhypercarbia, therefore, requiring a transfer to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit on  for respiratory distress and\\nacidosis.  The patient was placed on BiPAP and given\\nSolu-Medrol.  The patient did well with BiPAP over two days\\nand patient's respiratory distress resolved.  Chest CT\\ndemonstrated pleural thickening with nodular characteristics\\nand question of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

The infant was on CPAP at 6 in room air until\\n at which time she was reintubated secondary to\\nmultiple apneic bradycardiac spells.  She was initially on\\nsetting of 18/5 and a rate of 16.  However, due to increasing\\ndesaturation, slight hypercarbia and decreased volumes on\\nchest x-ray, her settings were slowly increased over the\\nfollowing 1 1/2 weeks to a peak of 25/7 and a rate of 22.\\nShe received one dose of Lasix on  and then received\\nLasix on  and  due to evidence of pulmonary edema on\\nchest x-ray.  On  (day of life 33), the infant self-\\nextubated and was given a trial of CPAP of 7 where she\\ncurrently remains in 29 to 33 percent FIO2.  Blood gas on\\nCPAP of 7 was 7.4, 46, 32, 24.  Plan will be maintaining on\\nCPAP with a slow wean and she grows.  The infant is not on\\nchronic diuretics at this time, although she did have some\\nbenefit from the Lasix that she did receive.\\n\\nCardiovascular.  The infant has not had a murmur and has\\nremained cardiovascularly stable without need for pressor\\nsupport.  She has remained on caffeine which was increased to\\n10 mg per kg per day.  Since she has been extubated, she has\\nhad no apnea, bradycardia.\\n\\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The infant had a central\\nPICC line in place and was on TPN and Intralipid.  She was\\nslowly advanced on enteral feedings and reached full feedings\\non day of life 13.  She has been advanced on calories and is\\ncurrently receiving PE 30 plus ProMod all NG with appropriate\\nweight gain.  She was also started on Fer-In- and vitamin\\nE once she reached full enteral feedings.  She remains on\\nthose medications at this time.  Her most recent set of\\nelectrolytes done on  was 135, 5.3, 102, 27.  These\\nwere done the day after she received her most recent dose of\\nLasix.  The infant currently has no IV access.  The infant\\nhad hyponatremia once she reached full enteral feedings with\\nsodium as low as 130 for which she was placed on 2 mEq per\\nday of enteral sodium chloride supplement.  Her most recent\\nsodium was 135 and this was after receiving one dose of\\nLasix.\\n\\nGI.  Serial bilirubins were followed and she was treated with\\nphototherapy beginning on day of life 2.  Her peak bilirubin\\nwas 2.9/0.3 on day of life 3.  Phototherapy was discontinued\\non day of life 8 and her rebound bilirubin was 2.1/0.4 on day\\nof life 9.\\n\\nHematology.  Initial hematocrit was 41.  The infant was\\ntransfused on day of life 5 for blood out.  Repeat hematocrit\\non day of life 12 was 32.5.  Due to increased spells she was\\ntransfused 20 cc per kg on day of life 14 and then again on\\nday of life 28.  She has had no further transfusions and has\\nnot had repeat hematocrit or reticulocyte count since prior\\nto her most recent transfusion.\\n\\nInfectious disease.  The infant was initially treated with\\nampicillin and gentamicin for the first 48 hours of life.\\nCultures were negative and antibiotics were discontinued.  On\\nday of life 12 she had CBC and blood culture drawn secondary\\nto question of redness around her umbilicus and was placed on\\noxacillin initially, but then was switched to vancomycin and\\ngentamicin.  These were continued for 72 hours while awaiting\\ncultures that were negative.  She was clinically improved\\nafter intubation over this time and antibiotics were\\ndiscontinued.  She has had no further issues with potential\\ninfection since that time.\\n\\nNeurology.  The infant had initial head ultrasound done on\\nday of life 5 that was normal.  She also had a repeat done on\\nday of life 29 that was normal.  She will need a repeat head\\nultrasound on day of life 60.\\n\\nPKU.  Initial PKU was abnormal in several aspects and was\\nresent.

Normal amniocentesis and fetal survey.\\nPregnancy complicated by hypertension at onset of 24 weeks,\\ntreated with bedrest, Nifedipine and magnesium.\\nBetamethasone administered at 24 weeks.  Today worsening,\\nhypertension and transaminitis leading to cesarean section\\nunder spinal anesthesia.  Rupture of membranes at delivery,\\nyielding clear amniotic fluids.  Breech extraction, no\\ninterpartum fever or other clinical evidence of\\nchorioamnionitis, no intrapartum antibiotic therapy.\\n\\nNeonatal course:  Infant initially hypotonic and apneic with\\nheart rate approximately 60 beats/minute, orally and nasally\\nbulb suctioned, dried and inspiratory pressures required for\\nchest excursions of 30 to 40 cm of water.  Orally intubated\\nat 1 to 2 minutes with poor respiratory effort and\\nbradycardia with rapid resolution of bradycardia, onset is\\nspontaneous respirations and decrease in inspiratory pressure\\nrequirement to approximately 25 cm.  Apgars 2 at one minute\\nand 7 at five minutes, transferred eventually to Neonatal\\nIntensive Care Unit.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Ventilated on SIMV,\\nsettings of positive inspiratory pressure of 25, positive\\nend-expiratory pressure 5 at a rate of 25, sating 98% on room\\nair.  Birthweight was 625 gm.  Anterior fontanelle soft and\\nflat, nondysmorphic, palate intact.  Neck normal.  Chest with\\nmoderate retractions and spontaneous breaths.  Good excursion\\nwith IMV.  Good breath sounds bilaterally, scattered coarse\\ncrackles, well perfused, regular rhythm with normal rate.\\nFemoral pulses normal S1 and S2, normal.  No murmur.  Abdomen\\nis soft, nondistended, no organomegaly, no masses.  Bowel\\nsounds active.  Anus is patent.  Genitourinary, normal female\\ngenitalia, active and responsive to stimuli.  Axial\\nappendicular tone decreased in symmetric distributions,\\nconsistent with gestational age, moving all limbs\\nsymmetrically, gag intact, grasp symmetric.  Moderate\\nbruising on head, trunk and right arm otherwise unremarkable.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  (By systems)  Respiratory - The patient\\nremained intubated, quickly weaned on ventilator setting and\\nwas able to extubate by day of life #3.  She was started on\\ncaffeine on day of life #2 and remains on caffeine at 5\\nmg/kg/day.  Caffeine was bolused and increased on day of life\\n#5 for increased spells.  She is now averaging approximately\\nsix spells a day on a CPAP of 6 cm.\\n\\nCardiovascular -   has remained hemodynamically\\nstable without any need for blood pressure support.  She has\\nhad no murmur.\\n\\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Fluids were started on\\nday of life #1 at 100 cc/kg/day with 10% dextrose solution\\nand was started on parenteral nutrition by day of life #2.\\nShe is currently receiving 30 cc/kg/day of formula or\\nbreastmilk, and tolerating well.  Dextrose sticks have always\\nremained stable.  Electrolytes have been within normal\\nlimits.\\n\\nHeme - Phototherapy was initiated on day of life #1.  Peak\\nbilirubin was on day of life #3 with a total of 2.9 and\\ndirect of .3.  At the time of dictation she remains on one\\nphototherapy bank.  Hematocrit at birth was 41.  On day of\\nlife #5, hematocrit was 35 and she was transfused 5 cc/kg\\nmostly to replace blood taken.  Platelets were 213 at birth.\\n\\nInfectious disease - She was started on Ampicillin and\\nGentamicin at birth and continued for 48 hours until cultures\\nremained negative.\\n\\nNeurology - Head ultrasound on day of life #6 was normal.\\n\\n\\n\\nReviewed By:    , M.D.  \\nDictated By:\\n\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    15:45\\nT:    08:50\\nJOB#:  \\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

She\\nquit tobacco five years ago.  No alcohol.  No illicit drugs.\\nNo intravenous drug use.  No transfusions.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the\\npatient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,\\nher respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,\\nand her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6\\nliters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She\\nwas unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was\\ncachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination\\nrevealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The\\nextraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was\\nsupple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax\\nrevealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.\\nCardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were\\nno murmurs.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

F\\n\\nService:\\n\\n\\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for\\ntransplant surgery.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old\\nwoman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant\\nhypertension. She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T & B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.

THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old\\nAfrican-American male with a history of hypertension who was\\nin his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the\\nmorning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n   \n","\n","                                                  ICD9_CODE  \\\n","0  [2639, 6826, 4280, 41071, 4254, 5849, 78559, 0389, 4275]   \n","1   [E9317, 042, 1363, 7994, 2763, 7907, 5715, 04111, V090]   \n","2        [40391, 4440, 9972, 2766, 2767, 2859, 2753, V1582]   \n","3                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","4                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               DIAGNOSIS_DESC  \n","0                                         [Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition, Cellulitis and abscess of leg, except foot, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Subendocardial infarction, initial episode of care, Other primary cardiomyopathies, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Other shock without mention of trauma, Unspecified septicemia, Cardiac arrest]  \n","1  [Antiviral drugs causing adverse effects in therapeutic use, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease, Pneumocystosis, Cachexia, Alkalosis, Bacteremia, Cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol, Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site, Infection with microorganisms resistant to penicillins]  \n","2                                                                        [Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage V or end stage renal disease, nan, Peripheral vascular complications, not elsewhere classified, nan, Hyperpotassemia, Anemia, unspecified, Disorders of phosphorus metabolism, Personal history of tobacco use]  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-b8e85114-b267-46e2-9149-caaa99a29325\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>HADM_ID</th>\n","      <th>SUBJECT_ID</th>\n","      <th>AGE</th>\n","      <th>GENDER</th>\n","      <th>NOTES</th>\n","      <th>ICD9_CODE</th>\n","      <th>DIAGNOSIS_DESC</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>145834.0</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>76.0</td>\n","      <td>M</td>\n","      <td>\\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:  Medicine\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for\\nhypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and\\ndecreased urine output.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old\\nmale who had been hospitalized at the  from  through  of \\nafter undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was\\nsubsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nOn , he presented again to the  after being found to have a systolic\\nblood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.\\nA Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility\\nyielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

The mucous membranes were dry.  The\\nextraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was\\nsupple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax\\nrevealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.\\nCardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were\\nno murmurs.  The abdomen revealed mild diffuse tenderness to\\npercussion, hepatomegaly 6 cm below the costal margin, no\\nspleen palpated, positive bowel sounds.  There was no rebound\\nor guarding.  Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.\\nPulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial\\nnerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was  in all\\nextremities.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had\\na white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%\\nlymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.  Primaquine 26.3 two tablets by mouth every day (times 14\\ndays).\\n 5.  Levoxyl 25 mcg by mouth once per day.\\n 6.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg by mouth once per\\nday.\\n 7.

She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T &amp; B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.

Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n</td>\n","      <td>[431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]</td>\n","      <td>[Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-b8e85114-b267-46e2-9149-caaa99a29325')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-b8e85114-b267-46e2-9149-caaa99a29325 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

The pt demonstrated a\\nmarkedly dilute urine with a low serum sodium and serum\\nosmolality.  In the differential diagnosis was medication effect\\n(clozapine, which causes SIADH), although this is much less\\nlikely given his low urine Osm. The pt corrected his serum\\nsodium with fluid restriction.  His sodium went from 116 to 130,\\nto 134 and then to 139 with q2h serum sodium checks.  A renal\\nconsult was obtained, because of the initial question of him\\ncorrecting his sodium at too rapid a rate.  His IVF were\\ndiscontinued (initially given to slow down the rate of his\\ncorrection of Na.)  At discharge, his serum sodium had\\nnormalized, and pt was mentally clear, oriented to person,\\nplace, and time.  He was producing a more concentrated urine,\\nwith Urine osm at discharge in the 400s.  For comparison, at\\nadmission, his urine osm was 87.\\n.\\n- Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure: Episode probably related to\\nhyponatremia. We did not feel it was necessary to start\\nanti-seizure medications, given the pt had a clear inciting\\nevent, and demonstrated rapid improvement in 24 hours.  He has a\\nhistory of tonic clonic seizure related to hyponatremia in the\\npast.  He needs close monitoring at his group home for increased\\nfluid intake, to prevent hyponatremia.  His group home\\nadministrator/RN will be contact prior to discharge.  Also\\nwith tongue lacerations from his seizure, healing now.  He also\\nhad some low back pain after his seizure, which the patient\\nstated was \\\"improved\\\" with Tylenol.\\n.\\nPer Dr . , renal attending, the serum Na was not low\\nenough to explain his seizure. Therefore, other causes for\\nseizure need to be ruled out. Pt needs an outpatient EEG and a\\nhead MRI. It is also recommended that steps are taken to\\ndecrease pt's mouth dryness. Specifically, pt should be\\nencouraged to use hard candy (sugar-free). If his medications\\ncan be changed to a regimen that does not cause so much mouth\\ndryness, that would also be advisable. Obviously, please advise\\npt on every possible occasion to limit his fluid intake and try\\nto enforce fluid restriction as much as possible.\\n.\\n- MS change: Probably from hyponatremia +/- post-ictal. Also, MS\\nchange + originally elevated WBC w/bands raised concern for\\nmeningitis, but pt afebrile so held off on LP.  His bandemia\\nresolved within 24 hours.  It was felt he demonstrated an\\nelevated WBC ct in the setting of seizure with hyponatremia.\\nHis bandemia resolved on subsequent labs.  He remained afebrile.\\n His mental status immediately improved with normalization of\\nhis serum sodium.  It was not felt that the patient had mental\\nstatus changes from infectious etiology.\\n.\\n- DM: The patient was started on an Insulin sliding scale. He\\ntolerated a diabetic diet well, and we will restart oral\\nhypoglycemic medications when pt eating.\\n.\\n- Schizophrenia: Cont outpt meds.  Pt is stable, alert and\\noriented to person, place and time. He was appropriate\\nthroughout his admission.  No active hallucinations/delusions.\\nFor outpt f/u, if his medications can be changed to a regimen\\nthat does not cause so much mouth dryness, that would also be\\nadvisable.\\n.\\n- Code status: Presumed full code, and was unable to reach his\\ndaughter on the telephone for clarification.\\n\\nAddendum:\\nThe recommendations of Dr . , renal attending, are:\\n1) Obviously, please advise pt on every possible occasion to\\nlimit his fluid intake and try to enforce fluid restriction as\\nmuch as possible.\\n\\n2) It is also recommended that steps are taken to decrease pt's\\nmouth dryness. Specifically, pt should be encouraged to use hard\\ncandy (sugar-free).\\n\\n3) If his medications can be changed to a regimen that does not\\ncause so much mouth dryness, that would also be advisable.\\n\\nAccording to Dr , the serum Na was not low enough to\\nexplain his seizure. Therefore, other causes for seizure need to\\nbe ruled out. Pt needs an outpatient EEG and a head MRI.\\n\\nThe MRI was completed in the hospital before discharge.  The EEG\\nwill need completion as an outpatient.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nACETAMINOPHEN 650MG--One tablet by mouth q4hours as needed for\\nmild pain, headache\\nACTOS 45 mg--One (1) tablet po once a day.\\nASPIRIN 325MG--One by mouth every day\\nByetta 5 mcg/0.02 mL--5mcg twice a day   snow\\nCLOZAPINE 100MG--200 mg by mouth every day (per psychiatry\\nrecords)\\nCOLACE 100MG--Take one pill twice a day\\nEFFEXOR XR 150MG--2 tabs ( 300mg ) every day\\nGLUCOMETER --Type 2 diabetes fs every other day in the morning\\nGLUCOPHAGE 1000MG--One tablet by mouth twice a day\\nGLYBURIDE 5MG--Two tabs twice a day\\nLANCETS --As directed\\nMILK OF MAGNESIA 800 mg/5mL--Thirty (30) cc po at bedtime as\\nneeded for constipation.\\nONE TOUCH TEST STRIPS --Type 2 diabetes- check fs fasting every\\nother day\\nPantoprazole Sodium 40 mg--One (1) tablet, delayed release\\n(e.c.) po twice a day.\\nTRAZODONE HCL 100MG--One tablet at bedtime\\nTRILAFON 8MG--8 mg three times a day\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

F\\n\\nService:\\n\\n\\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for\\ntransplant surgery.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old\\nwoman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant\\nhypertension. She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T & B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the\\nfirst 6 weeks after surgery.\\n\\nDIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal\\ntransplant.\\nArterial thrombosis.\\nDeep venous

THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old\\nAfrican-American male with a history of hypertension who was\\nin his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the\\nmorning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\n","Name: NOTES, dtype: object"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>NOTES</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>\\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:  Medicine\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for\\nhypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and\\ndecreased urine output.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old\\nmale who had been hospitalized at the  from  through  of \\nafter undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was\\nsubsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nOn , he presented again to the  after being found to have a systolic\\nblood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.\\nA Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility\\nyielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T &amp; B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.

He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> object</label>"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"collapsed":true,"id":"e607a76b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753846114987,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":4304,"user":{"displayName":"Pasindu Ambegoda","userId":"06530733606875410990"}},"outputId":"74ab7ebe-549e-450c-8a53-8403b7732b73"},"source":["# Create a new DataFrame by dropping 'HADM_ID' and 'SUBJECT_ID' columns\n","df_without_ids = final_df.drop(columns=['HADM_ID', 'SUBJECT_ID'])\n","\n","# Drop rows where 'DIAGNOSIS_DESC' or 'NOTES' are null\n","df_cleaned = df_without_ids.dropna(subset=['DIAGNOSIS_DESC', 'NOTES']).copy()\n","\n","print(f\"Original number of rows: {len(df_without_ids)}\")\n","print(f\"Number of rows after dropping nulls: {len(df_cleaned)}\")\n","\n","print(\"\\nFirst 5 rows of the cleaned DataFrame:\")\n","display(df_cleaned.head())\n","\n","# Save the new DataFrame to a new CSV file\n","output_csv_path = \"cleaned_mimic_notes_only.csv\"\n","df_cleaned.to_csv(output_csv_path, index=False)\n","\n","print(f\"✅ Done!

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

F\\n\\nService:\\n\\n\\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for\\ntransplant surgery.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old\\nwoman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant\\nhypertension. She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T & B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the\\nfirst 6 weeks after surgery.\\n\\nDIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal\\ntransplant.\\nArterial thrombosis.\\nDeep venous

THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old\\nAfrican-American male with a history of hypertension who was\\nin his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the\\nmorning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n   \n","\n","                                                  ICD9_CODE  \\\n","0  [2639, 6826, 4280, 41071, 4254, 5849, 78559, 0389, 4275]   \n","1   [E9317, 042, 1363, 7994, 2763, 7907, 5715, 04111, V090]   \n","2        [40391, 4440, 9972, 2766, 2767, 2859, 2753, V1582]   \n","3                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","4                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               DIAGNOSIS_DESC  \n","0                                         [Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition, Cellulitis and abscess of leg, except foot, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Subendocardial infarction, initial episode of care, Other primary cardiomyopathies, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Other shock without mention of trauma, Unspecified septicemia, Cardiac arrest]  \n","1  [Antiviral drugs causing adverse effects in therapeutic use, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease, Pneumocystosis, Cachexia, Alkalosis, Bacteremia, Cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol, Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site, Infection with microorganisms resistant to penicillins]  \n","2                                                                        [Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage V or end stage renal disease, nan, Peripheral vascular complications, not elsewhere classified, nan, Hyperpotassemia, Anemia, unspecified, Disorders of phosphorus metabolism, Personal history of tobacco use]  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-cc924d51-a6e4-4f06-85ce-5242d8dc968d\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>AGE</th>\n","      <th>GENDER</th>\n","      <th>NOTES</th>\n","      <th>ICD9_CODE</th>\n","      <th>DIAGNOSIS_DESC</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>76.0</td>\n","      <td>M</td>\n","      <td>\\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:  Medicine\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for\\nhypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and\\ndecreased urine output.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old\\nmale who had been hospitalized at the  from  through  of \\nafter undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was\\nsubsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nOn , he presented again to the  after being found to have a systolic\\nblood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.\\nA Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility\\nyielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.

She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T &amp; B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.

Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.

Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.

CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ICD9_CODE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DIAGNOSIS_DESC\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["✅ Done!

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

She\\nquit tobacco five years ago.  No alcohol.  No illicit drugs.\\nNo intravenous drug use.  No transfusions.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the\\npatient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,\\nher respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,\\nand her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6\\nliters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She\\nwas unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was\\ncachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination\\nrevealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The\\nextraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was\\nsupple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax\\nrevealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.\\nCardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were\\nno murmurs.

Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.

F\\n\\nService:\\n\\n\\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for\\ntransplant surgery.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old\\nwoman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant\\nhypertension. She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T & B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.

THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old\\nAfrican-American male with a history of hypertension who was\\nin his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the\\nmorning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a\\nfew minutes later his family found him slumped onto the\\nfloor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his\\nright arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into\\nthe Emergency Department at .\\n\\nThe patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.\\nHe has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac\\nsymptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n   \n","\n","                                                  ICD9_CODE  \\\n","0  [2639, 6826, 4280, 41071, 4254, 5849, 78559, 0389, 4275]   \n","1   [E9317, 042, 1363, 7994, 2763, 7907, 5715, 04111, V090]   \n","2        [40391, 4440, 9972, 2766, 2767, 2859, 2753, V1582]   \n","3                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","4                       [431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               DIAGNOSIS_DESC  \n","0                                         [Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition, Cellulitis and abscess of leg, except foot, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Subendocardial infarction, initial episode of care, Other primary cardiomyopathies, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Other shock without mention of trauma, Unspecified septicemia, Cardiac arrest]  \n","1  [Antiviral drugs causing adverse effects in therapeutic use, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease, Pneumocystosis, Cachexia, Alkalosis, Bacteremia, Cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol, Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site, Infection with microorganisms resistant to penicillins]  \n","2                                                                        [Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage V or end stage renal disease, nan, Peripheral vascular complications, not elsewhere classified, nan, Hyperpotassemia, Anemia, unspecified, Disorders of phosphorus metabolism, Personal history of tobacco use]  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                             [Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-e75d5311-2da6-4d2f-b7d8-c02fc24608de\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>AGE</th>\n","      <th>GENDER</th>\n","      <th>NOTES</th>\n","      <th>ICD9_CODE</th>\n","      <th>DIAGNOSIS_DESC</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>76.0</td>\n","      <td>M</td>\n","      <td>\\n\\n     Sex:  M\\n\\nService:  Medicine\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for\\nhypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and\\ndecreased urine output.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old\\nmale who had been hospitalized at the  from  through  of \\nafter undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was\\nsubsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nOn , he presented again to the  after being found to have a systolic\\nblood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.\\nA Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility\\nyielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.\\nPulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial\\nnerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was  in all\\nextremities.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had\\na white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%\\nlymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were\\nwithin normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a\\ncreatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.  Primaquine 26.3 two tablets by mouth every day (times 14\\ndays).\\n 5.  Levoxyl 25 mcg by mouth once per day.\\n 6.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg by mouth once per\\nday.\\n 7.

She was started on dialysis in .  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears\\nto be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia\\nwhich she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on  for\\na scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is\\nthe donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)\\nand will have a final T &amp; B cell class match prior to\\ntransplantation.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to\\nmalignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia\\nfollowing gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for\\ncoronary artery disease for diabetes.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a\\nhistory of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.\\nOccasional alcohol.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs\\nwere stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.  The\\npatient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day\\nlocated on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and\\nher skin.

The patient was unable to talk for examination and\\nno family members were present at the bedside and were not at\\nhome (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).\\nThe history was obtained by EMS.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.\\n\\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications\\nupon admission.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives .\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute\\nexamination, the patient became progressively less responsive\\nand then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during\\nthe examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart\\nrate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:\\nThis was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n</td>\n","      <td>[431, 5070, 4280, 5849, 2765, 4019]</td>\n","      <td>[Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-e75d5311-2da6-4d2f-b7d8-c02fc24608de')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-e75d5311-2da6-4d2f-b7d8-c02fc24608de button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.

There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

He is a\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\npulse,  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\n\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\nthe chest compared with a  study.  No\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\npneumonia.\\n\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated .\\n\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\n\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\n\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\npressure.\\n\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\n\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on \\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\nof ; the left ventricular function was\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\n\\nOn , the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\n\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\n\\nBy , he was off pressors and he was\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\n\\nOn the evening of , the patient complained\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\nalthough, this was discontinued on  when\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on ; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\nenzymes.\\n\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\non , the patient was still significantly\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\n\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\nfluids.\\n\\nOn , his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\n, and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\ndiscontinued on .\\n\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\nnegative on .\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\nhe was extubated on .  He subsequently\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\nrespiratory secretions.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\n\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\n\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\nwound healing.\\n\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\npacked red blood cells on  to maintain a\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\nremained stable.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:    rehabilitation facility.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n 1.

Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,\\nher alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase\\nwas 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct\\nbilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was\\nnegative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive\\nfor 30 protein.\\n\\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\\nsinus tachycardia; unchanged from .\\n\\nA chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in\\nthe left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or viral pneumonia.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.\\nNo gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\\n\\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient\\nwas transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit secondary\\nto respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a\\nrespectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with\\npossible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.\\n\\nGiven her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was\\nstarted on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage\\nwith primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on\\nprednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her\\nlow PAO2.\\n\\nIn the  Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed\\nwith 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears\\nwere negative.\\n\\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her\\nmedication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive\\npositive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to\\nsaturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on\\nprimaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of\\nantibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.\\n\\n2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from\\nadmission from  and  grew out\\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( blood\\ncultures).  At that time, the patient was started on\\nvancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out\\nendocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;\\nalthough, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her\\nperipherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent\\nsurveillance blood cultures from  on were negative,\\nand the patient was to be continued on vancomycin\\nintravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood\\ncultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient\\nremained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.\\n\\n3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class\\ncirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in .  Her\\ncirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. \\nin  for a visit.\\n\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the\\npatient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and\\nwas within normal limits.\\n\\n4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was\\nrestarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen\\non hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these\\nmedications without any problems.  She was also continued on\\nacyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was\\nto follow up with Dr.  in clinic over the next two\\nweeks.\\n\\n5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on\\noriginal regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary\\nto her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated\\nwhile in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her\\nLantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the\\nmorning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with\\nimproved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units\\nof Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the\\nnext three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which\\ntime her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,\\nand her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.\\n\\n6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\\nLevoxyl.\\n\\n7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter\\nline was placed on  for intravenous antibiotics.\\nIt was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was\\npulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the\\nsuperior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted\\ncentral catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her\\ncourse of intravenous vancomycin.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed\\nto follow up with Dr.  for cirrhosis and with Dr.\\n for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to\\nfollow up with Dr.   and Dr.   next\\nFriday for primary care.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\\n 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20\\nmg once per day times 11 days.\\n 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 4.

Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight\\n160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal\\ndialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good\\nfemoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On , the patient went to the\\noperating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed\\nby Dr.  and assisting by Dr. . Please see details\\nof this surgery in operating room note. Also during her\\noperating room time, the patient also had a right iliac\\nartery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the\\ncompletion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic\\nappearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In\\nthe operation, there was some difficulty with arterial\\nanastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.\\n came to assist Dr. .  Again, please see\\ndetails of that operation in the operative report.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.\\nThe patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was\\nplaced on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The\\npatient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had\\n2   drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good\\ndorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The\\npatient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal\\nwas consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the\\npatient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable\\nrenal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance\\nof the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and\\nresistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.\\n\\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient had another\\nultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they\\nwanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that\\nthere was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted\\nkidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from\\nyesterday which was on  with a small amount of pelvic\\nectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The\\npatient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.\\nHer heparin was discontinued on . The patient received\\n1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was\\nstarted.  On , the patient had some complaint of right\\nfoot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to\\nrule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence\\nof right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On ,\\nWBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5,\\nPTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,\\n100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.\\n\\nVascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was\\ndecided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be\\ncontinued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient\\nstill complained of right foot numbness but it was about the\\nsame and not worse.  She was continued on all of her\\nimmunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,\\nCellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned\\nfrom heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the\\nfloor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient\\nhad another ultrasound on  because there was blood in\\nher   drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.\\nUltrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,\\nblood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6\\nby 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to\\nthe contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral\\naspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal\\nblood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to\\nthis area on a follow up scan is recommended to document\\ninterval change or resolution.\\n\\nOn , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.\\nThe patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting\\nedema of right lower extremity greater than left lower\\nextremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the\\nright iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous\\nthrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial\\nfemoral veins which had developed since . There\\nis a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient\\ncontinued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was\\neventually removed, continued on  with drain output of\\n170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with\\nservices on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.\\nday, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin\\n5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a\\nday, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,\\nLopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg\\nq. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2\\nand 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at\\nbedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium\\nphosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours\\nprn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.\\n, please call  for an appointment.

HEENT:  The\\nneck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.\\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.\\nNeurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient\\nwas alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can\\ncomprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of\\nneglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the\\ncranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.\\nHis extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at\\nrest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.\\nHis power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and\\nleg was apparently .  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious\\nstimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal\\nthroughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination\\nand gait examination was not tested.\\n\\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,\\nplatelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.\\n\\nThe EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and\\nintervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in\\nI, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.\\n\\nSerum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The\\nurinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55\\nby 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to\\nthe right.\\n\\nChest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed\\nsecondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood\\npressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep\\nthe cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was\\nthen weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a\\nnicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load\\nfollowed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has\\nbeen therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and\\nangiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but\\nthe patient's renal function and health status did not allow\\nsuch studies to be done at the current time.\\n\\nRepeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in\\nthe bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral\\nedema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's\\nneurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he\\nonly had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal\\nreflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he\\nbegan to not move any extremities and not respond to any\\nnoxious stimuli in the four extremities.\\n\\nBy 4:00 p.m. on , his neurological condition\\ndeteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and\\nnonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were\\ndone at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery\\nwas reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt\\nthat the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in\\nthat it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along\\nwith hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt\\nto decrease the cerebral edema.\\n\\nDespite clinical examination that the patient is clinically\\nbrain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive\\ntreatment.  The family requested that the patient be\\ntransferred to the .  However,\\nDr.  at the  Stroke Service said\\nthat the patient would not be accepted at the  given that there would be no other intervention that\\nwould be done differently at .\\n\\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was\\ninitially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood\\npressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off\\nthe Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene\\ndrip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.\\nLabetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and\\nfound to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\n\\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when\\nfirst seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection\\nsince he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia\\non the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.\\nVancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization\\ndue to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.\\nSusceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one\\nor two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials\\nand increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to\\ndecongest him, saline nasal spray was started.\\n\\n4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.\\nThe patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued\\nto rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine\\nelectrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1\\nwhich is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and\\nprerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his\\ncreatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done\\nwhich showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration\\npneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and\\nFlagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures\\nwere obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four\\nblood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.\\nSince this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics\\nwere given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,\\nhis sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus\\ncoagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More\\nblood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.\\n\\n6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric\\ntube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube\\nfeeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote\\nGI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.\\n\\n7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The\\npatient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130\\non the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this\\nwas due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was\\nthen fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure\\nsecondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that\\nhe needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall\\nhyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              , M.D.  \\n\\nDictated By:\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:    07:03\\nT:    19:46\\nJOB#:  \\n\",\n","    \"input\": \"\",\n","    \"output\": \"Intracerebral hemorrhage, Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomitus, Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, nan, Unspecified essential hypertension\"\n","  }\n","]\n"]}]}]}
